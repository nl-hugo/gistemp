    <h1>Visualizing GISTEMP data in D3.js</h1>
	
    <p>This chart visualizes NASA's GISTEMP data. It shows temperatures in regions between the earth's circles of latitude over the period from 1880 until 2014. <br/>
	</br>
	I chose to visualize the data according to the 'small multiples' principle, whereby each region is displayed as a separate line chart. The regions are ordered from North (top) to South (bottom), thus representing their actual location on a globe. The temperatures are indexed to 1880's value(1880 = 0 degrees celcius) to make it easier to discover trends within regions. Also, with all multiples having the same scale, regions can be easily compared with each other. I used a greyish color as base color for the chart as to create a neutral canvas with sufficient contrast. Axis labels are slightly lighter, so that they do not draw away the user's attention of the actual data. Finally, the regions with the highest deviation are colored in purple, so that, besides their distinctive shape, they stand out from the others.
