    <h1>Visualizing GISTEMP data in D3.js</h1>
	
    <p>This graph visualizes the GISTEMP data. It shows the deviation from the mean Global temperature (grey line) for the Northern (blue) and Southern Hemispheres (pink) through 
	all the given years. <br/><br/>
	Interestingly, the chart shows that temperatures in the Northern and Southern hemispheres alternate with respect to the Global mean. From 1880 until 1920 for example, the 
	Northern hemisphere was warmer on average than the Southern hemisphere (with a small inversion around 1900), whereas in the period from 1920 until 1968 the Southern 
	hemisphere was relatively the warmest (with small inversions around 1945, 1957 and 1965).
