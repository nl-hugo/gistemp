# NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)

## Overview

This project is an assignment as part of the [Data Visualization course](https://class.coursera.org/datavisualization-001). It aims to explore the NASA data set and to get 
hands-on experience with the topics that are covered in the course.

The graph shows the deviation from the mean Global temperature (grey line) for the Northern (blue) and Southern Hemispheres (pink) through all the given years.	

Interestingly, the chart shows that temperatures in the Northern and Southern hemispheres alternate with respect to the Global mean. From 1880 until 1920 for example, the 
Northern hemisphere was warmer on average than the Southern hemisphere (with a small inversion around 1900), whereas in the period from 1920 until 1968 the Southern hemisphere was 
relatively the warmest (with small inversions around 1945, 1957 and 1965).

## Raw Data

The data set was downloaded as [zip-file](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/datavisualization/programming_assignment_1/Programming%20Assignment%201%20Data%20New.zip) from the 
course website. It is adapted from the data set at NASA's [GISTEMP website](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/).

The data set contains global temperatures from 1880 until 2014.


## Data Cleaning 

The data set was already preprocessed by the course instructor. No additional cleaning was necessary.
