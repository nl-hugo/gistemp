## Raw Data

The data set was downloaded as [zip-file](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/datavisualization/programming_assignment_1/Programming%20Assignment%201%20Data%20New.zip) from the 
course website. It is adapted from the data set at NASA's [GISTEMP website](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/).

The data set contains global temperatures from 1880 until 2014.


## Data Cleaning 

The data set was already preprocessed by the course instructor. No additional cleaning was necessary.
